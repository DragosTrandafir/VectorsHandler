Solving complex OOP problems in Python

Objectives 
Development of Python modules to solve complex problems
• Develop Python modules and classes
• Use test-driven development
• Learn how to work with exceptions
• Familiarize with special libraries e.g. numpy, matplotlib

Requirements
1. Implementing a solution for the problems using classes and feature driven 
development
2. The solution offers a console type interface that allows the user to input 
the data and visualize the output
3. The program uses only the standard and compound data types available in Python
The application is developed along several iterations and the solution
ensures:
• Providing at least 10 data examples in the application
• Documentation and testing of each function (at least 3 assertions)
• Validation of data – when the user introduces invalid commands or data, a 
warning should be generated

PROBLEM SPECIFICATION
A math teacher needs a program that helps students perform different vector 
operations.

All the additional documentation is provided inside the python modules.
